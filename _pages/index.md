# My name is Emily and I'm a experienced technical writer workng in software documentation and UX wrting

At work, I enjoy simplifying complex systems and ideas. I've had the opportunity to learn and write about cutting-edge technologies in cyber security, bioinformatics, and finance–learning new things keeps me energized and excited at work. I'm looking for opportunities where I can continue to explore and grow as a writer, mentor, and developer. 

Outside of work you can find me tending to my tomatoes, cooking up a storm in the kitchen, or out enjoying the lakes.
