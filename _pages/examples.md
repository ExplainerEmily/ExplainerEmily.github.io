# UX writing
UX text is such an important piece of the documentation puzzleâ€“ it can answer common product questions without taking the user out of their workflow. Users want to be able to self service, so the right UX text empowers users to be successful on their own.  

Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with product designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# Product documentation
I am an expert in creating the right content needed for a feature, release, or integration. I use compile data from site analytics, support tickets, and internal stakeholders to prioritize documentation needs. 

Below are a few examples of tutorials and reference guides I have created from scratch.

# Static sites
I have built a few sites using static site generators, and I think they are great ways to create clean, efficient documentation. 

Below are some sites I have built myself: 

Developer documentation including an auto-generated API reference from an openAPI spec. [See the developer documentation](https://sdk.flywheel.io)
