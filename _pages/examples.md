# UX writing
UX text is such an important piece of the documentation puzzleâ€“ it can answer common product questions without taking the user out of their workflow. Users want to be able to self service, so the right UX text empowers users to be successful on their own.  

Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with product designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# Product documentation
I am an expert in creating the right content needed for a feature, release, or integration. I use compile data from site analytics, support tickets, and internal stakeholders to prioritize documentation needs. 

Below are a few examples of tutorials and reference guides I have created from scratch.

- Tutorial for creating a yaml template ([View the article online](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500006024162-Overview) | Download PDF)
- Reference article for config file ([View the article online](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406976465939-The-OHIF-config-file) | Downlod PDF)

 
# Static Sites
I have built a few sites using static site generators, and I think they are great ways to create clean, efficient documentation. Some examples of my sites: 
-  ![Developer Documentation portal](/assets/images/DeveloperDocumentationPortal.png) or you can [view it yourself](https://sdk.flywheel.io)
-  This site was even made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)!
