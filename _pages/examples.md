# UX writing
The most helpful kind of documentation is the one the user actually reads. That's why the UX text is such an important piece of the puzzleâ€“ it can answer common user questions while they are using the product. Or for more complex topics, walkthroughs can focus users on the most important tasks or guide the user to a longer tutorial.  

Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with product designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# Building robust, accurate, and helpful documentation
I am an expert in creating the right content needed for a feature, release, or integration.  

I've written for audiences from the average at-home computer user, academic researchers, experienced admins, and developers. The most helpful cotent meets the user where they are at, so I like to work with detailed user personas to better understand my audience. 

My experience building a documentation suite from scratch as a lone writer was difficult, but through it I learned how to prioritze work to make the most impact. It also required that I learned how to leverage my SMEs and other resources in the company. I found that through teaching others about documentation, I enjoy teaching and mentoring. In my next role I am looking for the opportunity to dig deeper into the mentor role and teach more junior writers the ins and outs of the role. 

I have mainly worked within scrum teams to write my documentation. I enjoy this approach because it allows me to be involved in decisions early on to help avoid more documentation issues. Sometimes writing out a process in a draft can show product and development that we should reconsider.

I have also written extensively about integrations, which require research into the other tool as well as leveraging their documentation to make sure users can complete the task

# Tools I've used
 New tools are coming out all time to help build great documentation, so one of my most useful skills is being able to learn how to use new tools as the role requires. My strongest tool skill is the ability to learn new tools. 
But in case you are wondering, here's some tools I have used in the past. 
## Static Sites
Static sites are great ways to create and publish clean, efficient documentation. I have experience integrating staic sites generators into Gitlab workflows, so that API and developer documentation can be updated along with the code. 

This site was even made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)! 

Here's an example of the developer documentation portal I created:

or you can [view it yourself](https://sdk.flywheel.io)

## Structured authoring

After reviewing the vast options available to create and maintain documentation, I choose to go with the structured authoring approach. Paligo is an XML-based tool that allowed me to write once and publish to multiple forms.
