# UX writing
Whenever possibly, Documentation should be icluded right where the user needs it â€“ exactly when they need it. This makes UX writing an important aspect of the user experience. Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with UX designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# Static Sites
Static sites are great ways to create a publish clean, efficient documentation. I have experience integrating staic sites generators into developer workflows, so that API and developer documentation can be updated along with the code. This site was even made with Jekyll static site generator!

# Getting Started Guides
Onboarding new users is a critical part of the user journey. These can compliment a well-designed onboarding experience to make the user feel comfortable and can be updated as you gather data on what issues users are having.
