# UX writing
The most helpful kind of documentation is the one the user actually reads. That's why the UX text is such an important piece of the puzzleâ€“ it can answer common user questions while they are using the product. Or for more complex topics, walkthroughs can focus users on the most important tasks or guide the user to a longer tutorial.  

Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with product designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# Static Sites
Static sites are great ways to create a publish clean, efficient documentation. I have experience integrating staic sites generators into Gitlab workflows, so that API and developer documentation can be updated along with the code. 

This site was even made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)! 

Here's an example of the developer documentation portal I created:

# Tutorials, getting started gudes, FAQs, and more!
I am an expert in creating the  right content needed for a feature, release, or integration. I've written for audiences from your average at-home computer user, academic researchers, experienced admins, and developers. I have experience tailoring content to meet each user where they are at. I enjoy creating detailed user personas to understand readers needs and wants.
