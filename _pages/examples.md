# UX writing
The most helpful kind of documentation is the one the user actually readsâ€“that's why UX copy is such an important piece of the puzzle. It can answer a user's question without having to leave the product. With good copy and product design, more complex user tasks can be broken down into managable chunks. 

Here's some examples of times when I have collaborated with product designers and developers to create helpful UX text.

# User personas and customer journey maps
I am an expert in creating the right content needed for a feature, release, or integration.    

I've written for for a wide-range of audiences-including the average at-home computer user, academic researchers, experienced admins, and developers. The key to writing helpful content for any audience is to meet the user where they are at, which is why I like to work with detailed user personas and customer journey maps to better understand the intended audience for my writing.  

# Product documentation
The bulk of my experience is in building product documentation. I have written getting started guides, integation guides, FAQs, and reference material from scratch. Building a documentation suite from a few articles to over 250 as a lone writer was difficult, but it is also a great way to learn the importance of prioritzation and how to make the most impact. 

It also required that I learned how to leverage SMEs and other resources in the company. Through teaching others about the importance of documentation, I have learned that I enjoy teaching and mentoring. In my next role I am looking for the opportunity to be in a mentor role and teach more junior writers the ins and outs. 

I have mainly worked within scrum teams to write my documentation. I enjoy this approach because it allows me to be involved in decisions early on to help avoid more documentation issues. Sometimes writing out a process in a draft can show product and development that we should reconsider how a feature works.

# Tools I've used
 My strongest skill is the ability to learn new tools. New tools are coming out all time to help build great documentation, so I am a strong believer in one of my most useful skills is being able to learn how to use new tools as the role requires. 
But in case you are wondering, here's some tools I have used in the past. 
## Static Sites
Static sites are great ways to create and publish clean, efficient documentation. I have experience integrating staic sites generators into Gitlab workflows, so that API and developer documentation can be updated along with the code. 

This site was even made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)! 

Here's an example of the developer documentation portal I created:

## Structured authoring

After reviewing the vast options available to create and maintain documentation, I choose to go with the structured authoring approach. Paligo is an XML-based tool that allows me to write once and publish to multiple forms.
